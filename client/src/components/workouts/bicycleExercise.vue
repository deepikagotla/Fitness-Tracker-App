                        Burning body and belly fat with cardio exercises is half the battle. 
                        Next is strengthening abdominal muscles so you have something to show once 
                        the fat is shed. In a recent study, ab exercises were ranked from best to 
                        worst. The bicycle exercise ranked as #1 because it requires abdominal 
                        stabilization, body rotation, and more abdominal muscle activity.
