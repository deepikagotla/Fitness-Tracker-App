					For starters: how much time can you devote to exercise?
If you can do an hour a day, that’s awesome.
			  
				  </p>
				  <p>
						If you have a wife or husband, three kids, a dog, two jobs, and no robot butler, then maybe you only have thirty minutes, twice a week.
						That’s fine too.
				  </p>
				  <p>
						Whatever your time commitment is, developing the most efficient workout is crucial. Why spend two hours in a gym when you can get just as much accomplished in 30 minutes, right?
