      Mental fitness is essentially a set of mental exercises that each and every one of us should
be doing to ensure our minds are in tip-top shape and our attitudes are flowing in the right
direction. Mental fitness has little to do with intelligence or IQ tests and a lot more to do with
positive thinking and affirmations. The benefits that can come from daily mental fitness
exercises are nearly endless, from better sleep to lower anxiety to higher self-confidence.
Here are some different exercises you can do to get your mental fitness game on point.
